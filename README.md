# dungeon.io
This personal project of mine is going to be a web-based, procedural co-op dungeon crawler written in Node. I'm treating it as an exercise to polish up my general game development skills.

## Deployment
Though it doesn't do much right now, you can launch the server using
```
node index.js
```
Web browsers will eventually be served the client page through `socket.io` upon connection.
