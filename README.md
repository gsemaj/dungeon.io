# dungeon.io
This personal project of mine is going to be a web-based, procedural co-op dungeon crawler written in Node. I'm treating it as an exercise to polish up my general game development skills.

## Deployment
Ensure you have both `npm` and `node` installed.
Though it doesn't do much right now, you can build the server with
```
npm install
```
and then deploy using
```
npm start
```
Web browsers will eventually be served the client page through `socket.io` upon connection.
